# SE115 – Map Project

A Java-based program that simulates a map system where users can add cities, define routes, and calculate the fastest route between two locations.

---

## 🧠 Overview
This project was developed as part of **SE115 – Introduction to Software Engineering** at **Izmir University of Economics**.

The program reads a text file containing city and route information, builds a map structure, and computes the fastest route between two specified cities using pathfinding logic.

---

## ⚙️ Classes & Structure
- **City.java** → Represents a city (name, display method).
- **CountryMap.java** → Manages cities and their connections.
- **WayFinder.java** → Implements the shortest path algorithm and route calculations.
- **Main.java** → Handles file I/O, user input, and result output.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Reads input data from `.txt` file  
- Calculates the fastest route between two cities  
- Writes results and errors to output files  
- Modular OOP design using Java classes  
- Implements loops, arrays, and exception handling  

---

## 🧩 Example Output
Fastest Way: A -> C -> E
Total Time: 50 min

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java**  
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- **File I/O**  
- **Git & GitHub**
